# TransportCompanyWebApp
Web application in Java using Spring Framework

This project was made by Aleksandra Ziobrowska and Pawel Owczarek (ITermiTI) for Database 2 course on Wroclaw University of Technology. 

The topic of our project is a simple app to support transport company in delivering packages. It has two types of users - a client, who orders deliveries
and a driver, who performs this task. 

Our app is written in JAVA and uses Spring Framework, Hibernate/JPA and Spring Security (to support) both authentication and authorization process.
Thymeleaf engine and bootstrap.css was used in building views. The app is built in MVC architecture.
